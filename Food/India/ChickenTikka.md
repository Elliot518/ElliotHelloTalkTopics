### Chicken Tikka Buddha Bowl

<hr>

Ordered Indian food for takeout today.

Chicken Tikka Buddha Bowl
It has rice, chickens, potatoes, onions.
The onions taste a little bit like pickles.
The sauce tastes very strong。
Overall it's spicy but delicious。
But it can't be my day-to-day meal because I don't eat spicy food much.
Anyway, a nice exotic food experience, isn't it?
