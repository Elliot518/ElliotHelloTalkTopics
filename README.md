### Topic1

### Do you like your current job? Why?

> Are you satisfied with your current job? You love it or you do it just to make a living?

- Summary

    Some people do their jobs for interest while some others just to make a living.
    But still we should have a dream, right?
    Some people can learn a lot knowledage from their work, like special techniques, language practising with colleagues in other countries or even travel abroad.
    That's greate experience, isn't it?
    Anyway, we should all love our current job, if don't like it, why suffering yourself?
    Maybe it's the time for you to change it.

### Topic2

### Do you have your role models?

> A role model is someone you admire and want to learn from them. 
They could be your friends, parents, teachers, or some famous people. 
They are the motivations to keep you forward. 

- Summary

    We all have our role models. Someone said it's his wife, someone said it's her sister, someone said it's his friend, someone said it's very famous person like Elon Musk, someone said it's super star like Priyanka Chopra, someone said it's very famous scholar like Dr. Jayashankar.

    Anyway, different people have different role models.
    But the common thing is, our role models are like our lamps, they indicate our life diirections, they are the motivations to keep us forward!

### Topic3

### Ideal working environment?

> What is the most ideal working environment in your mind?
For example, you want a height-adjustable table, so you can sit or stand as you wish.
You want a comfortable chair, you want a sofa, you want flowers around you, you want to work in a silent location, or even you want to work in a forest...
Just use your imagination to talk.

- Summary

    An ideal working environment is very necessary. When we talk about it, we should not only consider those hardwares such as big desktop, multiple monitors, height-adjustable table, plants and flowers, we should consider the elements besides hardwares as well, such as a good colleagues relationship, a good atmosphere for researching, good and friendly company culture for employees' healthcare, for example: yoga, meditation, etc.
    Anyway, an ideal working environment can help us improve our working efficiency and work happily.

### Topic4

### EQ or IQ,which one is important?

>EQ = Emotional Quotient
>
>IQ = Intelligence Quotient

- Summary

    If you have a high IQ, that means you are very smart. If you have a high EQ, that meanes you are very good at communication. We must admit, IQ and EQ are both imporarnt. Someone said, if you got a high IQ, you can improve your EQ by your IQ. I think in some way, it's true. But I think improve your EQ is not as easy as you think, it includes a lot aspects such as understand the other people, emotion control etc. Since IQ is naturally born, we can do nothing about it, while EQ could really be improved by your deeper experience and understanding of the world.
    What we need to do is to be humble and work hard to improve ourselves.

### Topic5

> Do you have generation gap with your parents? 
Or with some elderly people like your boss?
Tell us about what you understand about the generation gap, how to deal with it or just leave it?
