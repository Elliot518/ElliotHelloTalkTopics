### Topic1

### Do you like your current job? Why?

> Are you satisfied with your current job? You love it or you do it just to make a living?

- Summary

    Some people do their jobs for interest while some others just to make a living.
    But still we should have a dream, right?
    Some people can learn a lot knowledage from their work, like special techniques, language practising with colleagues in other countries or even travel abroad.
    That's greate experience, isn't it?
    Anyway, we should all love our current job, if don't like it, why suffering yourself?
    Maybe it's the time for you to change it.

<hr>

### Topic2

### Do you have your role models?

> A role model is someone you admire and want to learn from them. 
They could be your friends, parents, teachers, or some famous people. 
They are the motivations to keep you forward. 

- Summary

    We all have our role models. Someone said it's his wife, someone said it's her sister, someone said it's his friend, someone said it's very famous person like Elon Musk, someone said it's super star like Priyanka Chopra, someone said it's very famous scholar like Dr. Jayashankar.

    Anyway, different people have different role models.
    But the common thing is, our role models are like our lamps, they indicate our life diirections, they are the motivations to keep us forward!

### Topic3

### Ideal working environment?

> What is the most ideal working environment in your mind?
For example, you want a height-adjustable table, so you can sit or stand as you wish.
You want a comfortable chair, you want a sofa, you want flowers around you, you want to work in a silent location, or even you want to work in a forest...
Just use your imagination to talk.

- Summary

    An ideal working environment is very necessary. When we talk about it, we should not only consider those hardwares such as big desktop, multiple monitors, height-adjustable table, plants and flowers, we should consider the elements besides hardwares as well, such as a good colleagues relationship, a good atmosphere for researching, good and friendly company culture for employees' healthcare, for example: yoga, meditation, etc.
    Anyway, an ideal working environment can help us improve our working efficiency and work happily.

### Topic4

### EQ or IQ,which one is important?

>EQ = Emotional Quotient
>
>IQ = Intelligence Quotient

- Summary

    If you have a high IQ, that means you are very smart. If you have a high EQ, that meanes you are very good at communication. We must admit, IQ and EQ are both imporarnt. Someone said, if you got a high IQ, you can improve your EQ by your IQ. I think in some way, it's true. But I think improve your EQ is not as easy as you think, it includes a lot aspects such as understand the other people, emotion control etc. Since IQ is naturally born, we can do nothing about it, while EQ could really be improved by your deeper experience and understanding of the world.
    What we need to do is to be humble and work hard to improve ourselves.

Smart? Talent?
>
>Or
>
>Persistence and endurance?
Never give up?Let us know your opinion!


- Summary
    
    How to define a person to be successful? That's a very good question.<br>
    Someone said a successful person must be rich or powerful, that's true, but I also think for ordinary people's success, if they did a great job
    in their normal work, we can also call that success. <br>
    So what qualities should a successful person have?<br>
    Someone mentioned hard working and healthy body, that's absolutely.<br>
    No pain, no gain. Hard working is mandatory elements we should have if we
    want to be successful.<br>
    Besides that, healthy body, persistence and endurance, these are also very important, because to be successful is like a long-time target, you need abundant physical strength and energy to support your hard working, and you
    should never give up even experienced many failures.
    Someone talked about concentration, I agree with that because success needs focus. <br>
    Someone mentioned a good and positive mood is very necessary, yes, that's true,
    if we want to achieve our goals, we must have a healthy mind, depression and unhappy should never be friends of success, right?<br>
    In conclusion, a successful person should have a lot of good and positive qualities, it's quite hard to have those qualities which also means to be successful also needs a lot of our efforts, but it's worthy, isn't it?<br>
    Let's try to be a successful person! <br>

### Topic8

### Can justice always defeat evil?

> As an old saying goes: Justice may be late, but it will never be absent!
>
> Can justice always defeat evil?
>
> Welcome to join my voice room to express your opinion.

- Summary

    Before we talk about the topic can justice always defeat evil, I think we'd better figure out the definition of justice. How to define justice? What is justice? Regarding this the speakers have different opinions.
    Someone thought justice could only be defined be the winners, by the power, by the authority. Though I don't want to admit it, it's true. If you look back at history, there are many such facts, We don’t want to give examples here because this involves sensitive information. What you need to know is that this is the truth, a truth that we are forced but unwilling to admit.
    So in that way, they thought justice can't always defeat evil.
    But the others who hold opposing views believe that "justice can always defeat evil", they believe there're supreme power who can punish the evil, sooner or later, the evil people will eventually get the punishment they deserve.
    I think it's on a religious level, I want to believe in the existence of the supreme power.

<hr>


### Topic9

### Opportunities? Challenges? Coexist?

> People always say: Where there are challenges, there are opportunities.
>
> Do opportunities always coexist with challenges?
>
> Accepting a challenge means taking risks.
Have you considered the risks?
Are you willing to take risks?
As an old Chinese saying goes: If you wanna seek wealth, you've got to risks.
Are you a risk taker?

- Summary
    People always say: Where there are challenges, there are opportunities.
    That means opportunities always coexist with challenges.
    Someone said challenges are always good because it make us grow.
    When facing challenges, if we fail, we can learn lessons from those failures,
    and finally we succeed. Think about those famous entrepreneurs, they all experienced many challenges and finally succeeded.
    Someone said accepting a challenge means we must jump out of our comfort zone.
    That's true, if we stay in our comfort zone without any challenges, we will not achieve great success and thus live an ordinary life.
    Someone said challenge means blessing and curse. Blessing means if we succeed, we will get huge rewards, but if we fail, we have to take huge losses which is a curse. Yes, that's true. Every sword has two edges, every coin has two sides, how can we enjoy success without taking risks? No pain, no gain, we must overcome those obstacles, that'll take great effort, consuming a lot of our time, you need a strong mind, persistence and endurance, some people may say that this is so tough, but isn't this the charm of the process of accepting challenges?

<hr>

### Topic10

### Suggest the movies you like

> Film is an art.

### Topic11

### Finish What You Start

> Have you ever started exercising but gave up after a while?
Have you ever read a book but didn't finish it?
Have you ever learned a skill but then stopped?
Have you ever set a flag but failed to complete it for one reason or another?
Do you remember how many times you started something but gave up halfway?
How can we make our short-term goals realized?


- Summary

    Finish What You Start, what does that mean?
    It means making your intentions reality.
    Too often, we say we’ll do something, and we might even start it on one lucky weekend.
    But as time goes by, it becomes difficult or we become busy or feel fatigue or bored, we normally abandon it too easily. <br>

    Thank you to many friends who participated in the discussion on this topic that day. <br>
    I summarized what everyone said about their experiences, the two most talked about are fitness and English learning. <br>
    Someone said she used to watch live English news online but gave up after persisting for a few weeks as it was too brain exhausting. <br>
    Someone said he got up very early in the morning and arrived at the company before 7:00 am just to recite English words, but he stopped after several months' persistence because he fell in love wth someone. <br>
    In these two cases of stopping learning English, the former was due to lack of persistence, and the latter was due to unexpected reasons.<br>
    Then we check the cases of fitness, some people say they gave up because they were lazy or too tired. <br>

    Based on the above, we see these keywords: lazy, tired, accidental reasons, it seems these are the key devils to stop us following through! <br>
    So, what Shall we do? <br>
    Have you ever seen the scene of Los Angeles at 4 am？<br>
    This is the classic quote left to us by the basketball superstar Kobe Bryant who already passed away. <br>
    Yes, I think we can find the answer in this superstar's legend. <br>
    The answer is self-descipline! <br>
    Self-discipline enables you to get your head down and work when you need to, even if you don’t want to.
    It’s the ability to control yourself so that you retain focus on what needs to be done, despite the temptations and distractions you may encounter. This element is essential because it gives you the power to regulate your own thoughts, feelings, actions toward ends that are meaningful to you. Without self-discipline, you wouldn’t be able to consistently make effort on something until it’s done. <br>

    About self-discipline we might have a lot to talk, I think maybe it could be our next wonderful topic! :-)

### Topic12

### Daily work or study

> Daily work or study takes most part of our lives.
Tell us about your daily work or study details.
How do you manage your time?
Is your daily work or study efficient? If not, how do you think you can improve it?

- Summary

    Most people spend quite a long time in their commuting time every working day because they live in the suburb and need to go to work in the downtown area. Therefore they raise a good habbit to take full advantage of the fragmented time slots. For example, someone reads eBooks while taking a metro or bus. Some others listen to English podcast or news while driving to work. 

    During working hours, many people will be very busy from morning to night, and the pace is very fast.
    After work, some people like to do exercises to keep them fit while others prefer a leisurely walk in the park after dinner.

    In the fast-paced world of work, dealing with pressure is inevitable. But, what if the pressure emanates from your boss? The question arises – do you dare to argue with your boss? Here's a guide on how to handle such situations with finesse and professionalism.

    1. Taking Initiative: When faced with work pressure, taking initiative is key. Don't wait for problems to escalate; address them promptly and proactively.

    2. Staying Calm: Maintaining composure is crucial. Take a step back, breathe, and approach the situation with a clear mind. Emotional intelligence is your ally in navigating workplace challenges.

    3. Building Relationships: Making friends with your boss is not just about socializing; it's about understanding their perspective. A positive relationship can create a conducive environment for open communication.

    4. Professionalism Amid Frustration: It's natural to feel frustrated, but maintaining professionalism is non-negotiable. Keep emotions in check, and express your concerns in a composed manner.

    5. Confirm Your Ground: Before engaging in a disagreement, ensure you are well-informed and confident in your stance. Being 90% sure of your argument strengthens your position.

    6. Reading Body Language: A skillful communicator reads not just words but also body language. Understand your boss's mental state and mood by observing cues, helping you gauge the right time to engage.

### Topic19

### Happy work with less money or opposite

> Modern people have a lot of work pressure.
Although some people earn high salary, they are under great pressure and are not happy at work. On the contrary, some people earn very little salary but are very happy at work.
What do you think contributes more to job satisfaction: a high salary or a low-stress work?
How do you think individuals can find a balance between a high-paying job and job satisfaction?
Is it possible to have both a high salary and a low-stress work in today's competitive job market?

- Summary

    I want to delve into a dilemma that many of us face: the choice between a job that pays well but is mentally and physically taxing, versus a job that brings happiness but may come with a thinner wallet.

    We all know that pressure is an unwelcome companion, and it comes in various forms, both mental and physical. The question we grapple with is how to strike that delicate balance between chasing success and maintaining our well-being.

    In our quest for the ideal job, we often overlook the importance of spare time and the pursuit of hobbies. It's in these moments of leisure that we find solace, recharge our spirits, and discover the essence of life beyond the workplace. Achieving a work life balance is not just a buzzword; it's a fundamental human need.

    Desire is a powerful force within us, and it's crucial to acknowledge that money plays a pivotal role in fulfilling our basic needs. However, there's an inspiring example of someone who opted for a job with a higher salary and promotion, only to find themselves drowning in a sea of stress. This vividly illustrates the age-old adage: money can't buy happiness.

    As our cash flow sustains our basic life, it's essential to consider the repercussions of choosing a higher salary. Money, as we all know, has the potential to turn people into the very thing they may despise greedy and selfish. The allure of a fatter paycheck might blind us to the toll it takes on our character.

    But let's not forget, some might opt for a higher salary out of necessity, driven by high consumption needs, whether it's frequent travel or a penchant for going abroad. The clash between financial goals and personal happiness is a real struggle many face.

    Career development is undoubtedly a critical factor in decision-making. Some argue for a high starting point, a leap forward that others might take years to reach. However, in the pursuit of success, we must not neglect the importance of relaxation, for sometimes, to move forward, we need to take a step back and allow our minds and bodies to recharge.

    In conclusion, the decision between a high-paying job and a fulfilling one is never easy. It's a nuanced interplay of pressures, desires, and the delicate dance of work and life. As we navigate this complex terrain, let us not forget that true success encompasses not just our professional achievements but also our well-being and the happiness we find in the journey.

### Great minds mature late

> Great minds mature late is an idiom refers to some people achieve outstanding achievements when they are quite old, we can also call them late bloomer.
Describe a famous person in history you know who was a late bloomer,
tell us some of his experience, and what inspiration can we get from his experience?

- Summary

    "Great minds mature late." It's not just an idiom, it's a profound insight into the intricate dance of life, experience, and the ever-evolving journey of self-discovery.

    You've all heard the saying, "late bloomer," right? Well, let me tell you, there's more to it than meets the eye. We live in a world that often celebrates the quick and the flashy, but there's a quiet force at work, a force that defies the norms and takes its time to unfold great minds mature late.

    Looking back at world history, there have been many late bloomers who became famous:
    - Abraham Lincoln, the revered American president, preserved the Union and ended slavery with grace.
    - Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's partner, turns setbacks into success through financial wisdom.
    - Albert Einstein, a visionary physicist, reshaped cosmic understanding with groundbreaking theories.
    - Morgan Freeman, an iconic voice of wisdom, reflects enduring maturity in a storied film career.

    Picture a sequoia, towering majestically over the forest, its growth slow and deliberate. It stands as a testament to the power of patience and the beauty of a journey that embraces the passage of time. So, too, do great minds. Maturity isn't a race; it's a journey, and for some, the brilliance of their minds takes time to fully blossom.

    Now, let's talk about maturity levels and how we react to the various situations life throws our way. Life is a relentless teacher, and every challenge, every setback, is an opportunity for growth. A late bloomer doesn't wither under pressure; instead, they draw strength from the struggle, developing a maturity that can weather any storm.

    Think about the mental development that occurs over the years. It's not just about accumulating knowledge; it's about understanding the intricacies of the human experience. Our great minds, like a fine wine, improve with age. They process life's lessons, distilling them into wisdom that stands the test of time.
