### Topic1

### Do you like your current job? Why?

> Are you satisfied with your current job? You love it or you do it just to make a living?

- Summary

    Some people do their jobs for interest while some others just to make a living.
    But still we should have a dream, right?
    Some people can learn a lot knowledage from their work, like special techniques, language practising with colleagues in other countries or even travel abroad.
    That's greate experience, isn't it?
    Anyway, we should all love our current job, if don't like it, why suffering yourself?
    Maybe it's the time for you to change it.
