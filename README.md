### Topic1

### Do you like your current job? Why?

> Are you satisfied with your current job? You love it or you do it just to make a living?

- Summary

    Some people do their jobs for interest while some others just to make a living.
    But still we should have a dream, right?
    Some people can learn a lot knowledage from their work, like special techniques, language practising with colleagues in other countries or even travel abroad.
    That's greate experience, isn't it?
    Anyway, we should all love our current job, if don't like it, why suffering yourself?
    Maybe it's the time for you to change it.

### Topic2

### Do you have your role models?

> A role model is someone you admire and want to learn from them. 
They could be your friends, parents, teachers, or some famous people. 
They are the motivations to keep you forward. 

- Summary

    We all have our role models. Someone said it's his wife, someone said it's her sister, someone said it's his friend, someone said it's very famous person like Elon Musk, someone said it's super star like Priyanka Chopra, someone said it's very famous scholar like Dr. Jayashankar.

    Anyway, different people have different role models.
    But the common thing is, our role models are like our lamps, they indicate our life diirections, they are the motivations to keep us forward!

### Topic3

### Ideal working environment?

> What is the most ideal working environment in your mind?
For example, you want a height-adjustable table, so you can sit or stand as you wish.
You want a comfortable chair, you want a sofa, you want flowers around you, you want to work in a silent location, or even you want to work in a forest...
Just use your imagination to talk.

- Summary

    An ideal working environment is very necessary. When we talk about it, we should not only consider those hardwares such as big desktop, multiple monitors, height-adjustable table, plants and flowers, we should consider the elements besides hardwares as well, such as a good colleagues relationship, a good atmosphere for researching, good and friendly company culture for employees' healthcare, for example: yoga, meditation, etc.
    Anyway, an ideal working environment can help us improve our working efficiency and work happily.

### Topic4

### EQ or IQ,which one is important?

>EQ = Emotional Quotient
>
>IQ = Intelligence Quotient

- Summary

    If you have a high IQ, that means you are very smart. If you have a high EQ, that meanes you are very good at communication. We must admit, IQ and EQ are both imporarnt. Someone said, if you got a high IQ, you can improve your EQ by your IQ. I think in some way, it's true. But I think improve your EQ is not as easy as you think, it includes a lot aspects such as understand the other people, emotion control etc. Since IQ is naturally born, we can do nothing about it, while EQ could really be improved by your deeper experience and understanding of the world.
    What we need to do is to be humble and work hard to improve ourselves.

### Topic5

> Do you have generation gap with your parents? 
Or with some elderly people like your boss?

### Topic6

### Do you make plans?How?

> Life is to setup various targets. Someone want to become rich, someone want to become a famous star, someone just want to be good in his or her job. No matter your targets are big or small, you indeed should setup them, because without targets you will easily get lost just like a ship sailing in the sea has no direction. Ok, so if you already setup your targets, what you need to do is to make them real or implemented. How? The answer is to make plans! How do you setup your plans? The plans could be daily or weekly or monthly or by several years. Welcome to join my voice room to express your opinion.

> What qualities should a successful person have?
Smart? Talent?
>
>Or
>
>Persistence and endurance?
Never give up?Let us know your opinion!


- Summary
    
    How to define a person to be successful? That's a very good question.<br>
    Someone said a successful person must be rich or powerful, that's true, but I also think for ordinary people's success, if they did a great job
    in their normal work, we can also call that success. <br>
    So what qualities should a successful person have?<br>
    Someone mentioned hard working and healthy body, that's absolutely.<br>
    No pain, no gain. Hard working is mandatory elements we should have if we
    want to be successful.<br>
    Besides that, healthy body, persistence and endurance, these are also very important, because to be successful is like a long-time target, you need abundant physical strength and energy to support your hard working, and you
    should never give up even experienced many failures.
    Someone talked about concentration, I agree with that because success needs focus. <br>
    Someone mentioned a good and positive mood is very necessary, yes, that's true,
    if we want to achieve our goals, we must have a healthy mind, depression and unhappy should never be friends of success, right?<br>
    In conclusion, a successful person should have a lot of good and positive qualities, it's quite hard to have those qualities which also means to be successful also needs a lot of our efforts, but it's worthy, isn't it?<br>
    Let's try to be a successful person!

### Topic9

### Opportunities? Challenges? Coexist?

> People always say: Where there are challenges, there are opportunities.
>

Have you considered the risks?

As an old Chinese saying goes: If you wanna seek wealth, you've got to risks.
Are you a risk taker?
