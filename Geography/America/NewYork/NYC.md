## New York City

<hr>

> New York City situated on a large natural harbor composed of five boroughs /ˈbɜːroʊ/ (区，自治的镇), they are Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, and of course Manhattan.


All streets are perpendicular ˌpɜːrpənˈdɪkjələr/ (垂直的) and form a grid.

55% of the households don't car there.
New York City is the most popular city in US, with a population of 8.8 million and 20 million people live in the metro area.

- Broadway

  > Broadway runs diagonally /daɪˈæɡənəli/ (对角线的) across the island


> The basic thing to remember is that avenues run north and south while streets run east and west

- Manhattan


  > Manhattan island is divided into lower manhanttan, midtown manhanttan and uptown regions. Times square is the main tourist destination midtown manhanttan led by its numerous billboards (广告牌). It got its name in 1904 when new york times moved its headquarters to the then newly erected times building, now it is called one times square. A times square billboard today runs from 5 thousand dollars to 50 thousand dollars a day. This place is always super crowded day and night but honestly it's much more impressive at night. It's kind of fun sitting there and watching the people and all the ads running around. If you like large crowds and street performances, you're gonna enjoy it. It lives up to its name the city that never sleeps.
