### Java Swing
> Swing is a standard part of Java. JavaFX was introduced as a more modern approach to GUI programming, but it must be downloaded and installed separately from Java itself, which makes it more complicated to use. Swing and JavaFX can both be used to write complex, fully functional GUI programs, and either one is a reasonable choice. Version 8 of this textbook used JavaFX. The alternative edition that uses Swing has been added for Version 9.
