### Creative Problem Solving

<hr>

Problem solving is an integral part of organizational life. 
Everytime a manager or leader directs people in producing 
a product or service, problems are being solved, decisions 
made. Every time any member of an organization thinks of 
a new way to reduce costs, invents a new product or service, 
or determines how to help the organization function better 
in some way, problem solving is taking place. But, whether 
the problem solving occurring in these situations is truly creative is another question, one that deserves a closer look. 
For individuals, the development of creative problem-solving 
skills is a necessity, not a luxury. Because organizations too must 
solve problems, the development of these skills in their members is also a necessity. The most innovative individuals and 
organizations are the ones most likely to survive and prosper.
