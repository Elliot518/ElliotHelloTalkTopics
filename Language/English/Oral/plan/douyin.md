> There's a Chinese internet celebrity named DYH. Currently, he has over 20 million followers on Douyin. He used to be an English teacher at New Oriental School which was an English school teaching Chinese English, but after the closure of the New Oriental language school, he started working as a sales anchor for New Oriental on Douyin. With his extensive knowledge, he often imparts wisdom to his audience during sales sessions, mostly about Chinese culture, classical poetry, and has gradually accumulated a large fan base.
