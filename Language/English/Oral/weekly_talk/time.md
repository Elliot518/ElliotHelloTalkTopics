My time is scattered all over the map <br>
我的时间很分散 <br>

- example 1
    > During the day, I have to go to work, and when I get back home in the evening, my time is scattered. There aren't many instances throughout the week where I can really focus and sit down to work for a few solid hours. That's why I need to make the most of my fragmented time.

- example 2
    > During the day, I have my work commitments, and once I'm back home in the evening, my time is all over the place. There are only a few occasions each week when I can truly concentrate and dedicate a chunk of time to sit down and work for a few solid hours. Hence, I need to make the most of these scattered time slots.
