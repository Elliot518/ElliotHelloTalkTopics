### 因为觉得很有趣，所以不知不觉忘记了时间
```
Because it was so amusing, I lost track of time without even realizing it.
Got so caught up in the fun, I totally lost track of time.
Time just slipped away unnoticed because I was having such a blast.
```

- have a blast 

    玩得开心
    ```
    eg:
    We are going to have a blast!
    我们打算要好好地狂欢一番。
    ```
