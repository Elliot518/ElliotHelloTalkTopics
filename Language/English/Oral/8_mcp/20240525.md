> I spent more than 3 hours developing and debugging the dynamic route function the night before yesterday. ChatGPT suddenly short-circuited and kept falling into an infinite loop. It repeatedly gave me similar answers, but it couldn't solve the problem. I worked until 12 pm in the evening and couldn't solve the problem. Then I decided to go to bed. The next night I changed my tactics. I adopted a step-by-step approach, split the problem into many small design ideas, and let ChatGPT assist me. Finally I solved all the issues and complete the Dynamic Route function. It was not easy.
