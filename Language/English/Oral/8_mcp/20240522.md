> So, we're putting together this crew, right? We hop on a Tencent meeting every week to brainstorm and grind together with like-minded folks, all in the name of progress. We're taking it slow and steady, building something meaningful brick by brick. These projects, they're like our dreams and aspirations, potential cash cows down the line, maybe even the foundation of our own gigs. Think of it like raising a kid in your spare time—this project? It's your baby, your ticket to the future. You know how some folks bust their tails day in, day out, but when you ask them what they've got to show for it years down the line, it's usually just a paycheck and some memories. Sad, ain't it? We're aiming for more than that.

Play to your strengths, exploit their weaknesses. That's the name of the game
