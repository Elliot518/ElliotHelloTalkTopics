## Career Development

<hr>

> If you are a person who makes a living by working, it's crucial to hustle smart and focus on leveling up our own game. Instead of grinding away without purpose, we've got to have a plan. Bosses or leaders whether whether you work for a private startup company, a big or even fortune 500 foreign company, a state-owned company, or even a central government invested company, they are not reliable.
The only rock-solid thing we've got is your own value. It's a law of the jungle out here in the job market. If you don't invest in yourself, don't expect others to come knocking. It's all about making yourself so indispensable that you're the one doing the choosing. When you're not adding value, trust me, you're as disposable as yesterday's trash.

打工人应该努力提升自己自身的价值，而不是每天没有价值地忙着，要有规划，领导靠不住，公司靠不住，靠得住的只有自身的价值。这条定律适合所有企业的打工人，不管你是私企，民企，外企，国企，央企。不懂得提升自己的价值，只有等企业来选择你，而不是你去选择企业，当你没有价值的时候，也可以把你像垃圾一样扔掉
