## unintentionally(无心而为)

<hr>

> 一个人心态越放松，对结果越不在意，往往收获更大。这就是无心生大用。唯有当一个人无心于结果时，心的力量才能最大化地呈现出来，因为无心才符合天道规律，自然而然，反之，一旦有心，就是刻意为之，反而忽略了过程的专注。

> The more relaxed someone's mindset and the less they care about the result, the often he will get greater rewards. It's like going with the flow without getting too hung up on results. Only when a person isn't fixated on the result can the full power of the mind be unleashed, because being too fixated goes against the natural order of things. Conversely(On the flip side), once there's overemphasis on results, even if subconsciously, it becomes a deliberate effort, and that might overshadow the necessary focus on the process.
