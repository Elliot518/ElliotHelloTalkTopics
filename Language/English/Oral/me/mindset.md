### mentality and performance

> For me, whether it's from studying to working, I've found that good results often come unexpectedly. I may attribute it to my mentality. I need to keep a low profile and work hard, but not obsess over the outcome, almost like I don't care about the results. However, for what I'm currently doing, I need to have passion without chasing results. Can you understand this feeling? It is to be relaxed, immersed. In the end, I often find that this state will get the best results. On the flip side, sometimes setting ambitious goals and putting too much pressure on myself doesn't lead to the desired outcomes. It's a bit in line with the Taoist philosophy in China.

> 对于我来说，从学习到工作，我发现好的结果都是在不经意间拿到的。我可能把它归结为心态，我需要保持低调，需要努力，但不要刻意追求结果，你可以认为是不在乎结果。但是，对于我正在做的事情，我需要热爱，但不追求结果，你能明白这种感觉吗，就是放松，沉浸其中，最好往往发现这样的状态都会拿到最好的结果。然而相反，有时候给自己设定了一个目标，给自己太大压力，往往拿不到想要的理想的结果。这个有点符合中国的道家思想。
