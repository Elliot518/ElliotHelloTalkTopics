## Scary Movies

Just watched The Texas Chain Saw Massacre 2022 version, gonna review it on Halloween

```
After nearly 50 years of hiding, Leatherface returns to terrorize a group of idealistic young friends who accidentally disrupt his carefully shielded world in a remote Texas town.

Leatherface snapped the young sheriff’s wrist with his bare hands,
he then used the exposed bone to stab the poor guy in the throat. 

But it didn't stop, as they were speeding down the road in a van, there was a fight for the gun. A shot went off, and boom—it hit the older sheriff, who was driving, killing him instantly. It’s chaos.

The van flipped, and when the woman in the passenger seat—one of the four young people—woke up, she was horrified. She saw Leatherface, making a mask out of his mother’s skin right in front of her. Terrified, she tried to run, but no matter how hard she fought, she couldn’t escape. In the end, she was also killed by the Leatherface man.

Is it fine I describe those details

Don’t worry, I’ll stick to the main storyline and just throw to you a few bloody & exciting scenes

When those two sheriffs showed up, they acted very tough, like they were in charge, but they got wiped out by Leatherface in seconds. In front of the absolute power, they were so small, so  powerless, so helpless.


Compared to Korean and Japanese horror movies, which leave you terrified for days long, sometimes they could even make me hard to sleep well for a week, they left a lasting psychological fear. But American horror movies? They’re more about blood, gore /ɡɔːr/, and thrills. It’s intense /ɪnˈtens/ while you’re watching, but it doesn’t really stick with you or leave that same mental impact afterwards

It was a windy and chilly out night

Anyone who is a fan of the original 1974 TCM knows that Leatherface wasn’t the only villain. The Sheriff and the rest of the family (Hitchhiker and Grandpa) were equally as scary. The way that the family controls Leatherface (because he had the mental capacity of a child) made him different from other contemporary slashers. This is what made that movie creepy and unsettling. It wasn’t because of blood and guts.
