There're four categories for the IELTS.
First is is fluency coherence and pronunciation, 
vocabulary or electrical resource and finally grammar
and the range and the accuracy.

So in terms of fluency coherence and pronunciation,
I thought you are really strong, that was a very nice job,
your pronunciation is very good, and you speak with a very natural rhythm.
Occasionally pausing just to think about answer, but that's totally natural.

The only possibility for improvement is, especially in part 2 and part 3,
there's really an opportunity to give longer answers, and really start to
build points on top of points and using words to connect ideas, that would
be a way to move your score up a little bit further.
Vocabulary is good, words generally used accurately, very good control,
the only thing within vocabulary would probably be to try to expand your range.
Use a few good words.
And it's sort of the same thing it would be, I mean I guess in terms of
mistakes, I heard a few of the small things(eg: you don't do things very often?) Something about the tense, you need to use the past tense rather than
the present tense to talk about your hometown.
