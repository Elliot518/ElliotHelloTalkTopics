Recommended IELTS Preparation Videos

This is an 11 hour IELTSAdvantage Complete IELTS Course. The information here is excellent. You shouldn't need to pay for an IELTS course after you watch this video. The only other YouTube channel I recommend is Completed Test Success.

This channel analyzes reading passages for new vocabulary and meaning. It's a good way to expand your reading and listening comprehension.

This is an advanced grammar video. It explains very subtle differences in meaning when using different advanced verb formation. It's these types of differences that you need to know to get an 8+ on the IELTS.
