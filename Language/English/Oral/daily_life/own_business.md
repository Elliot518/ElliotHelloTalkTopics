### It's just a beginning, not a lot of money, or even you can call it earning pocket money. But compared to the pocket money we’re earning, we value more on the foundational work we’re building. Such as things like setting up servers, building infrastructure code  to prepare for future innovative products, and we are and building a network of connections to our potential customers.

这只是一个开始，钱不多，甚至可以说是赚零花钱。但与赚的零花钱相比，我们更看重我们正在做的基础工作。比如设置服务器、构建基础设施代码以准备未来的创新产品，以及我们正在与潜在客户建立联系网络。

### I will definitely start my own business at some point. Right now, in my spare time, my coworker and I are laying the groundwork. We’re taking on some side projects that aren’t super urgent, expanding our network, and setting up the basic infrastructure. So when the time comes, we’ll be ready to hit the ground running.
