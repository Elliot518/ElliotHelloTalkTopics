## Daily Commute

<hr>

> My daily commute to work takes about 1 and half hours by metro and bus.


- Subway
```
When you're on the subway and standing in an awkward spot, everyone has to squeeze past you, either in front or behind. It gets pretty uncomfortable.

- Bus Stop Annoucement in Shanghai
```
When you're on a bus in Shanghai, the next stop is announced by an automated voice in three languages.
First in Mandarin, then in English, and finally in Shanghainese. 
As soon as one stop's announcement finishes, the next one is already on its way, so you're constantly surrounded by a mix of languages during the ride.
