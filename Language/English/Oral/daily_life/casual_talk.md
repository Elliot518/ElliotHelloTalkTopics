Your background noise kinda sounds like a chainsaw. I just watched **The Texas Chainsaw Massacre** /ˈmæsəkər/, so it’s freaking me out a bit


### Louisiana /luˌiːziˈænə/

### Inception

### contradictory

Someone wants to be a prostitute but also wants a chastity /ˈtʃæstəti/ arch,” meaning someone wants to do something dishonorable while still keeping a good reputation. It’s a clear example of contradiction

I remember watching an American movie about how, when someone dies, the brain remains active for a few hours. Then, someone develops a serum that turns people into zombies.

This phrasing keeps it natural and easy to understand.

### Matrix
- Keanu Reeves

### Spider in the morning
```
I totally believe that seeing a spider in the morning brings good luck because it’s happened to me so many times! I vividly remember the first time—it was back when I was in elementary school. I got up in the morning, looked in the mirror, and saw a white spider on it. That same day, I had a final exam, and math was super tough, but I was in the zone and ended up getting a perfect score. Meanwhile, everyone else did pretty badly, and they were all so mad at me!

### English popularity
Let’s say, out of 10 people, based on China’s aging population data, there are 5 elderly folks who belong to the older generation. Because of historical reasons, most of them stayed in China and don’t speak English. Out of the remaining people, it’s no exaggeration /ɪɡˌzædʒəˈreɪʃ(ə)n/ to say that about two-thirds have what we’d call ‘mute English’ or dumb English, they can understand but can’t really respond. So, the chances of you finding someone who can actually have a conversation with you is just a percentage—it’s really just a matter of probability
