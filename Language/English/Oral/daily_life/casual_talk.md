Someone wants to be a prostitute but also wants a chastity /ˈtʃæstəti/ arch,” meaning someone wants to do something dishonorable while still keeping a good reputation. It’s a clear example of contradiction

### Spider in the morning
```
I totally believe that seeing a spider in the morning brings good luck because it’s happened to me so many times! I vividly remember the first time—it was back when I was in elementary school. I got up in the morning, looked in the mirror, and saw a white spider on it. That same day, I had a final exam, and math was super tough, but I was in the zone and ended up getting a perfect score. Meanwhile, everyone else did pretty badly, and they were all so mad at me!
