Your background noise kinda sounds like a chainsaw. I just watched **The Texas Chainsaw Massacre** /ˈmæsəkər/, so it’s freaking me out a bit

### Inception

### contradictory

Someone wants to be a prostitute but also wants a chastity /ˈtʃæstəti/ arch,” meaning someone wants to do something dishonorable while still keeping a good reputation. It’s a clear example of contradiction

I remember watching an American movie about how, when someone dies, the brain remains active for a few hours. Then, someone develops a serum that turns people into zombies.

This phrasing keeps it natural and easy to understand.

### Matrix

### Spider in the morning
```
I totally believe that seeing a spider in the morning brings good luck because it’s happened to me so many times! I vividly remember the first time—it was back when I was in elementary school. I got up in the morning, looked in the mirror, and saw a white spider on it. That same day, I had a final exam, and math was super tough, but I was in the zone and ended up getting a perfect score. Meanwhile, everyone else did pretty badly, and they were all so mad at me!

### English popularity
```
Let’s say, out of 10 people, based on China’s aging population data, there are 5 elderly folks who belong to the older generation. Because of historical reasons, most of them stayed in China and don’t speak English. Out of the remaining people, it’s no exaggeration /ɪɡˌzædʒəˈreɪʃ(ə)n/ to say that about two-thirds have what we’d call ‘mute English’ or dumb English, they can understand but can’t really respond. So, the chances of you finding someone who can actually have a conversation with you is just a percentage—it’s really just a matter of probability

### Spanish

Spanish requires a lot of tongue rolling, and it takes practice. My tongue’s kind of clumsy, so I just can’t do it, so I gave up!

### hurricane /ˈhɜːrəkeɪn/
```
When a hurricane hits, it picks up a lot of debris /dəˈbriː/ pieces from houses and turns them into missiles. It’s pretty terrifying.
```

### old people working
```
A lot of elderly people in Japan are still working, like driving taxis, because of the real estate crash in the ’90s. When the property bubble burst, many people lost their savings and even ended up deep in debt, so they have no choice but to keep working, even when they should be retired
