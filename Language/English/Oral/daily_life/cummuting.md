### Crossroad "Traffic Cop"

Every day on my way to work, I pass through a crossroad, right at the entrance of a ground parking area. 
A lot of pedestrians /pəˈdestrɪən/ are constantly crossing there, and cars need to navigate through to 
get into the parking area.

There's a security guard standing at the crossroad, playing the role as a traffic cop,
directing the flow of vehicles. 
When a car is about to enter, he signals for pedestrians to hold up a second. 

I find it pretty thoughtful because, you know, it can be tricky for drivers and pedestrians to read each other's intentions. 
When judgment calls go wrong, accidents can easily happen. 
So, having someone in the middle, coordinating and directing, ensures a smooth passage for both pedestrians and vehicles.

It got me thinking about similar situations in our work, you know? 
Like project managers taking on the role of coordinators. 
They juggle tasks, making sure team members are on the same page, ensuring the project moves forward smoothly.

### Subway

```
the subway train in Shanghai is always very crowdy
most of the time, you don't get a seat
cause those seats are always occupied by the people queuing in the terminal station
I hate rat race in Shanghai, even for commuting

but today I'm a lucky dog cause I got a seat
It's cozy cause I can sleep in the train
but still I needa keep my ear open in case I miss my destination

you can either scan your QR code or swipe the card to take the subway
您可以扫描二维码或刷卡乘坐地铁

When you're on the subway and standing in an awkward spot, everyone has to squeeze past you, either in front or behind. It gets pretty uncomfortable.

In the morning when heading to work and getting to the subway entrance, 
there's sometimes this person standing in front of the card swipe gate. 
Most of the time, it's someone a bit older. 
They're blocking your way as they spend quite a while searching for the QR code on their phone. 
In that situation, you have to maneuver /məˈnuːvər/ around them, if you don't do that, you‘ll never know how long you might end up waiting.

早上上班的时候，进地铁站的刷卡闸机前，有时候会站着一个人，大部分时候是年纪大一点的人，他们挡在你的前面，在手机上找了半天二维码，这个时候你需要绕到他们前面去，因为你不知道会等多久

### Bus Stop Annoucement in Shanghai

When you're on a bus in Shanghai, the next stop is announced by an automated voice in three languages.
First in Mandarin, then in English, and finally in Shanghainese. 
As soon as one stop's announcement finishes, the next one is already on its way, so you're constantly surrounded by a mix of languages during the ride.

### 请给帮助需要的乘客让个座(give your seat to someone who needs help)
```

Would you mind giving your seat to someone who needs help?
Could you do a favor and let someone who needs assistance sit here?

## Little Dialog

### ear tips stuck
```
I had a little scare yesterday on my way to work. 
I was feeling hungry, so I stopped by a KFC. I had my wireless Bluetooth earbuds in, you know, the kind with the soft silicone ear tips. After I ordered, I sat down and was ready to enjoy my breakfast. But when I took out my earbuds, the left ear tip got stuck in my ear! I started to panic because I couldn’t see it, and when I tried to pull it out, it was stuck too tight, the more I tried, the deeper it seemed to go, and I freaked out for a second, thinking I might need to go to the hospital to get it out. But I decided to ask for help instead. I found one of the KFC workers, this older madam, she managed to pull it out for me. I was so appreciated!
And right after that, I immediately ordered a pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds online that don’t have any ear tips!

### Subway rushing
> Today, I took the subway. Just as the doors were closing, I rushed in, you know, because if I missed it, I’d have to wait a few more minutes. Once I got on, I zoned out listening to music, and I didn’t even realize when my stop came. I only noticed I missed a station when it was too late, so I got off and hopped back on the train to go back.
The time I thought I saved ended up being spent without even noticing.
It made me realize something about life. Some people work themselves to the bone, staying up late, and at first, they make a lot of money. But eventually, all that money goes toward medical bills.
