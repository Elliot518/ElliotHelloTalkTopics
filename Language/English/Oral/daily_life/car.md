### Fill up the tank of my car
给我的车加满油


```
This morning, I found my car’s right rear tire completely flat. I called my insurance company’s roadside assistance, and they sent a tow truck. We got it towed to the nearest auto repair shop for inspection and fixing.
The inspection showed that a sharp piece of metal had punctured my tire. Since my tires were already pretty old, I decided to go ahead and replace all four of them. I opted for a set of German-made Continental tires.
