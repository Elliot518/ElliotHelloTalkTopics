### Black Myth - WuKong

> I’m not sure if any of you have played Black Myth: Wukong, the Chinese single-player game, but it’s seriously awesome! It’s based on Journey to the West, one of China’s Four Great Classical Novels, so it’s a cool way to experience a bit of Chinese culture. Here are some wallpapers I found online—hope you guys like them!

This is the wallpaper from that popular Chinese single-player game, Black Myth: Wukong, that I mentioned to Jordan last time in Samantha’s room. I know he’s a big gamer, so you could show it to him—it’s super cool! The game is based on Journey to the West, one of the Four Great Classical Novels of China, so it’s a great way for him to get a bit of Chinese culture, too
