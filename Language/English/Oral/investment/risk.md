## Risk Control

<hr>

### I think risk control is just like putting eggs in baskets. You gotta play smart with those egg baskets. If some basket is making a lot of money, it's time to invest more in that basket. On the flip side, if some baskets aren't doing well, it's time to reduce investment or even completely get rid of them.
