### 1. A-shares Investment


> Investing in A-shares essentially boils down to finding microscopic and partial periodic certainty in the macroscopically chaotic and uncertain stock market. Therefore, the true essence of investing lies in seeking certainty within the specific phases of this overall chaos. Pursuing certainty is, in fact, the real essence of investing.

> Many stock traders mistakenly consider themselves investors, but in reality, they are not. They're more like high consumers, akin to gamblers. Gambling is not an investment strategy; it's just a betting technique, and in the long run, consistent gambling leads to losses.

A股投资的真谛是在宏观整体混沌不确定的股市里寻找微观局部阶段确定性, 因此，追求确定性才是真正的投资真谛。
许多股民自以为是投资者，事实上他们不是，他们其实是高消费者，是赌徒。赌术不是投资技术，它只是赌技，久赌必输。
