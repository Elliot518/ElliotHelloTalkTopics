### toast message

- Explanation:
    > A "toast message" in the context of technology and software typically refers to a brief notification or message that appears on a user's screen, often near the edge or corner. These messages are called "toasts" because they are analogous /əˈnæləɡəs/ to the concept of a toast in the real world—an announcement or brief statement made to get people's attention.

- Scenario:
    > Toast messages are commonly used to provide users with non-intrusive updates, alerts, or feedback about the status of an action they've taken or to convey information. These messages typically appear for a short duration and then fade away, allowing users to continue with their tasks without being disrupted.
