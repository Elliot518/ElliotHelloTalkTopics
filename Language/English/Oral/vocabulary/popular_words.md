### podcast

> A podcast is an audio program available for streaming or download on the internet. Podcasts cover a wide range of topics, including news, storytelling, interviews, education, and entertainment. Unlike vlogs, podcasts are typically consumed through audio platforms such as Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or other podcast apps. They allow listeners to tune in and engage with the content while doing other activities, such as commuting or exercising.
