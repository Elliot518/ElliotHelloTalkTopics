### sleep paralysis 
/pəˈræləsɪs/
```
From a scientific perspective, it’s sometimes said that sleeping with your hands behind your head can potentially increase the chances of experiencing the phenomenon known as sleep paralysis. This happens when your brain wakes up while your body remains in a state of paralysis, which can make it feel as though you’re unable to move, sometimes giving the sensation of being “held down” or experiencing a presence in the room. However, this is just one theory and doesn’t apply universally to everyone.

In Chinese, sleep paralysis has a creepy meaning, it’s like a ghost is pinning you down on your bed.
