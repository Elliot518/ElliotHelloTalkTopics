## Travel to Shaoxing

> During the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, which lasted for about ten days, I took my family on a road trip to Shaoxing City in Zhejiang Province. The place boasts picturesque cultural landscapes with its charming small bridges, flowing water, and traditional black awning boats. We also got to savor Shaoxing Huangjiu, a famous local rice wine. Today is the third day I'm back to work after the extended holiday.
