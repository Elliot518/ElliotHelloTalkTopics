> I had a conversation with a person on TikTok who was from another country. Although he didn't have an American accent, he claimed to have lived in New York City for 35 years. The initial conversation went smoothly, but things took a turn when I asked him a question. In the question, I mentioned that he wasn't a real American, and that instantly pissed him off. He accused me of being a racist, and immediately ended our conversation.


> I just don't get why he flew into a rage. Maybe deep down, he's fragile, feeling like he's spent 35 years living in the States, thinking he should be a real American by now.


This is normal. Work efficiency is pretty low in some third or fourth class cities in China.
