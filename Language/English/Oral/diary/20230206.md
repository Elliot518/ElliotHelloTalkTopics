Today was quite dangerous. Due to the freezing weather, I had the air conditioner on, 
I switched on the auxiliary heating mode to quickly warm up the whole room.
Then I smelled something like burnt wires. At first, I thought it was coming from outside, but upon checking, I realized it was inside my house. Turns out, it was a problem with the circuit breaker. The casing was really hot, and underneath the cover, it was glowing. So, I immediately turned off the air conditioner, went to the property management to get an electrician.

The electrician opened it up and found out we were lucky to catch it early. The neutral wire was completely burnt, and it also burned to the shelf above. He mentioned that if it had continued, it could have burned through the live wire or even the wires inside the wall, which could've been extremely dangerous.

Considering my home's quite old, around 20 years or so, I'll have to be more vigilant going forward. No plans for a renovation yet, gotta save some money for that

今天是相当危险的一天。由于天气寒冷，我开着空调，
我打开辅助加热模式，很快整个房间就暖和起来了。
然后我闻到了类似烧焦电线的味道。起初我以为是从外面传来的，但仔细一看，才发现是在我家里面。事实证明，这是断路器的问题。外壳非常热，盖子下面正在发光。于是，我立即关掉空调，去物业找电工。

电工打开一看，发现我们很幸运能早点抓住它。中性线完全烧毁了，也烧到了上面的架子上。他提到，如果继续下去，可能会烧断带电电线，甚至烧断墙内的电线，这是极其危险的。

考虑到我家已经很老了，大约有20年左右，我以后必须更加警惕。还没有装修计划，得存点钱
