## Competitiveness

> In many of the companies I've worked for, there's this common phenomenon where the employees who've been there longer tend to hide a lot of knowledge and skills from the newer ones. When you ask a veteran employee if there are any references or resources for a particular aspect of the project, they'd often say there aren't any, until much later when you've managed to figure things out on your own and realize there were actually plenty of resources available—they just didn't want to share at the time. This tactic of withholding crucial information from new employees is used by veteran employees to diminish the newcomers' competitiveness while enhancing their own. It's a widespread practice in the workplace. However, in my opinion, this approach is pretty useless. The best way to improve one's competitiveness is through continuous learning and self-improvement, rather than putting obstacles in the way of competitors.

> 在我工作过的许多公司中，存在这样一种普遍现象：任职时间较长的员工往往向新员工隐瞒很多知识和技能。当您询问资深员工是否有针对项目特定方面的任何参考资料或资源时，他们通常会说没有，直到很久以后，当您自己设法解决问题并意识到存在时实际上有很多可用资源——他们只是当时不想分享。老员工利用这种向新员工隐瞒重要信息的策略来削弱新员工的竞争力，同时增强自己的竞争力。这是工作场所的一种普遍做法。然而，在我看来，这种方法毫无用处。提高竞争力的最好方法是不断学习和自我完善，而不是给竞争对手设置障碍。
