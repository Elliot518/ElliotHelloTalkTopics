### Escalator /ˈeskəleɪtər/ story

One time I saw a Shanghai auntie on the escalator, totally into her phone. 
The escalator's going up, getting close to the top, and she was still immersed in her mobile phone. 
Then you might guess what happened, she almost fell down to the ground, 
but it seemed she didn't realize it was her fault, 
she turned around and started blaming the escalator, saying, 'Scared me so bad! This elevator's got issues.'
