suit yourself 你随便  <br>

你眼睛多少度 <br>
what's your prescription <br>
How strong are your glasses? <br>
How good is your eyesight?  <br>

have a short fuse 脾气暴躁 <br>

fingers crossed 祝一切顺利 <br>

My word is my bond 我说话算话 <br>


we never put on airs  我们从不装腔作势 <br>


The devil is in the details 细节决定成败 <br>

take compensation leave 调休 <br>

tasty yummy 好吃 <br>
