### 1. A full plate/A lot on your plate

> To have a full plate is to be very busy. The more that you have on your plate,
the busier you are. A plate is the flat dish that you eat food from, and as you
know, a full plate cannot fit any more food on it. Likewise, if your schedule
is full, you cannot agree to take on any more tasks.

```
A: Can you finish off Rob’s assignment, please?
B: I’m sorry, I’ve got a full plate at the moment, Sarah. I can’t take on any
more work.
A: Are you okay, Jennifer?
B: Yes, John. I’ve just got a lot on my plate right now.
```

### 2. Ahead of the curve

> If you are ahead of the curve, then you are ahead of those around you in
terms of current trends and/or business approaches. The expression is a
positive one and can be used in professional situations. It was originally
expressed as ahead of the power curve and dates to the 1920s when airplanes
were becoming more popular and common.
```
A: Jennifer’s Boutique(时装店，精品店) offers a unique dining and shopping experience.
There’s really no other place like it!
B: I know, they’re really ahead of the curve in main street shopping.

### 3. A learning curve

> To be on a learning curve means that you are quickly gaining knowledge in
a particular subject. Adjectives such as “steep,” “intense,” and “rapid” may
be added to give more meaning. Often, the phrase is used to illustrate that
someone has learned from a mistake.
```
A: This semester has been quite the learning curve for you, hasn’t it?
B: Yes, I feel like I’ve learned a lot with you.
A: How do you feel about yesterday’s performance?
B: It was terrible, the audience hated my jokes. But I’m on a learning curve
– I’ll change some of them for tomorrow.
