### That's what it really comes down to
这才是真正的原因


eg: what it really comes down to is your happiness (真正重要的是你的幸福)

> The phrase “That’s what it really comes down to” means identifying the core issue, essential factor, or final point in a situation. It’s commonly used in American English, especially in spoken conversation, to simplify a situation or summarize its main point after considering all aspects.


- Here are some scenarios to illustrate its use:
  ```
  1.	Work Discussion
  Context: You’re discussing a complex project and trying to identify the main hurdle.
  Person A: “We have to sort out timelines, resources, and roles, but I think it really comes down to getting client approval.”
  Person B: “Exactly. That’s what it really comes down to. Once they approve, everything else falls into place.”
    
  2.	Personal Advice
  Context: A friend is trying to decide whether to stay in a job.
  Person A: “I’m not sure if I should leave. There’s the pay, the location, and my team.”
  Person B: “But it sounds like what it really comes down to is your happiness. If you’re not happy, maybe it’s time to move on.”
    
  3.	Sports Commentary
  Context: Commentators discuss a game’s turning point.
  Commentator A: “They had a strong defense, but in the end, it really comes down to who scores the most in the last quarter.”
  Commentator B: “Right! That’s what it really comes down to in these close games.”
