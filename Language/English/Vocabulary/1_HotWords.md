#### What is the difference between rigid and strict?
> "Rigid" and "strict" are two words that are often used interchangeably, but they can have subtle /ˈsʌt(ə)l/
 (微妙的) differences in meaning.

- Rigid
```
Definition: 
Rigid refers to something that is stiff(僵硬的,不易弯曲的), inflexible, or resistant to change.

Usage: 
It is commonly used to describe objects, structures, or systems that do not bend easily and maintain their shape.

Example: 
The rules were rigid and did not allow for any exceptions.
```

- Strict
```
Definition: 
Strict refers to a high level of adherence /ədˈhɪrəns/ (遵守,坚持) to rules, principles, or standards.

Usage: 
It is often used to describe people, regulations, or guidelines that are closely and precisely followed.


Example: 
The teacher was strict about deadlines and expected assignments to be turned in on time.
```

> In summary, while both terms suggest a lack of flexibility, "rigid" often implies physical inflexibility or stiffness, whereas "strict" tends to focus more on a strict adherence to rules, guidelines, or principles, and it is frequently associated with human behavior or regulations.
