### Margarita

Margarita is a popular cocktail that typically consists of tequila, triple sec (orange-flavored liqueur), and lime juice. It is usually served in a salt-rimmed glass and can be either shaken with ice or blended to create a frozen version. The proportions of the ingredients can vary, but a common recipe includes 2 parts tequila, 1 part triple sec, and 1 part lime juice. The cocktail is often garnished with a lime wedge.

Margaritas are known for their refreshing and tangy flavor, making them a favorite choice for many people, especially in warm weather or at social gatherings. There are also numerous variations and creative twists on the classic Margarita, such as fruit-flavored versions or specialty ingredients.
