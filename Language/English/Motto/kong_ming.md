束发读诗书,修德兼修身,仰观与俯察,韬略胸中存。
<hr>
Tying back my hair, diving into the poetry,
Polishing virtues, self-improvement is the key.
Looking up at the stars, and down at the ground,
Strategizing quietly, wisdom all around.

丈夫在世当有为,为民播下太平春,余年还做垅亩民,清风明月入怀抱。
<hr>
A man living in the world should strive and soar,
Planting seeds of peace for the people galore.
In my remaining years, a farmer's life I'll live,
With clear winds and bright moons, my heart they'll sieve.
