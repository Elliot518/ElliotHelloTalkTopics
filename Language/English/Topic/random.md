## Hapiness

<hr>

Happiness sometimes is just very simple, it is to pursue what you want, the whole process is happiness.
What is your dream? Everyone got to have a dream.

- Taoism

    For Taoism, happiness is the pursuit of purity and inaction of your heart.
    Jump out of the box of normal perception.

    Most people live in the normal perception, they live because a lot people live in this way.

    For example: get a decent job, earn money, they bought a housem pay off mortgage  of your house, maybe for it'll take you decades to pay off your debt.

It involves taking actions to understand their priorities, communication styles, and preferences, and then adapting your approach to align with those factors. The goal of managing up is to contribute to a more productive and harmonious working relationship and to enhance overall team and organizational success.

- Anticipating Needs: Proactively identify and address the needs and priorities of your manager. This could involve providing solutions to potential issues before they arise or taking on tasks that alleviate their workload.

### Kids without marriage

In China nowadays, many young people are choosing not to get married

I'm not quite sure if the younger generation not getting married is a shift 
in lifestyle attitudes or a response to practical pressures
