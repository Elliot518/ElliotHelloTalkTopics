## Hapiness

<hr>

Happiness sometimes is just very simple, it is to pursue what you want, the whole process is happiness.
What is your dream? Everyone got to have a dream.

- Taoism

    For Taoism, happiness is the pursuit of purity and inaction of your heart.
    Jump out of the box of normal perception.

    Most people live in the normal perception, they live because a lot people live in this way.

    For example: get a decent job, earn money, they bought a housem pay off mortgage  of your house, maybe for it'll take you decades to pay off your debt.
