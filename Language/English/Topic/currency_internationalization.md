    Economist: Hey, have you ever thought about what drives the internationalization of a currency? It's not just about domestic factors, but also the external forces.

    Business Elite: Interesting thought. What do you mean by external forces?

    Economist: Well, think about it. The more goods and services your currency can buy, the more attractive it becomes. It's like a cycle – a strong currency helps build a robust trade network, and as a result, people naturally prefer using that currency.

    Business Elite: So, you're saying it's all about the purchasing power and the strength of the trade connections?

    Economist: Exactly. Look at countries with internationally accepted currencies; their purchasing power is solid, and they've built trade networks that are rock solid. It's like Mount Tai – steady and unwavering.

    Business Elite: Makes sense. But isn't there an element of pushing for it, like actively promoting the use of the currency?

    Economist: Sure, promotion helps, but the real deal is meeting the demands. True internationalization isn't forced; it's about becoming the go-to currency because it meets the needs of the people. It becomes the hard currency without the need for a hard push.

    Business Elite: So, it's more about creating an environment where people naturally want to use your currency?

    Economist: Bingo. It's about making your currency so appealing that people want to use it without feeling like it's imposed on them.

    Business Elite: That's a game-changer perspective. It's not just about policies, but creating a currency that people actually want in their pockets.

    Economist: Absolutely. It's about building a currency that speaks for itself in the global marketplace.

    Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining me today as we delve into the intriguing world of currency internationalization. Now, we often contemplate what propels a currency onto the international stage, and I'm here to share a perspective that transcends mere domestic factors. The driving force, my friends, lies not just within, but without.

    Consider this: the true might of a currency lies in what it can fetch, in the vast array of goods and services it can unlock. It's a symbiotic relationship—a resilient currency fosters a formidable trade network, and, as if by the force of nature, people gravitate towards using that currency.

    Imagine your currency as a key. The more doors it can unlock, the more appealing it becomes. It's not just about policies and economic strategies; it's about creating a currency so robust that it stands like Mount Tai – unyielding and resolute.

    Think about nations with globally embraced currencies. Their purchasing power is a force to be reckoned with, and their trade networks are as stable as the foundations of a mountain. But, my friends, it's not merely about imposing a currency on the world; it's about meeting the needs of the people. True internationalization is not a forced march; it's a dance—a dance where your currency becomes the partner everyone wants.

    Yes, promotion plays a role, but the essence lies in satisfying demands. Imagine a currency so enticing that people willingly embrace it. That, my friends, is the essence of true internationalization—a currency that doesn't need a hard push but becomes the hard currency naturally.

    Creating an environment where people yearn to use your currency is the goal. It's about making your currency so magnetic that people want it in their wallets, not because they're told to, but because it's undeniably the best choice.

    So, let's shift our focus. It's not just about policies; it's about creating a currency that resonates globally. It's about building a currency that isn't just accepted; it's desired. It's about transforming your currency into a global ambassador, speaking the language of commerce fluently in the international marketplace.

    In conclusion, let's aspire to create currencies that are not just symbols of economic strength but ambassadors of shared prosperity. Let's envision a world where the internationalization of a currency is not a forced journey but a natural evolution, driven by the simple yet profound principle – meet the needs, and the world will follow. Thank you.
