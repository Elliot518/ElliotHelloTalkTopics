```
The last emergency release looked like a hotfix, but in fact it was not. It was released as a temporary branch merged into master. The code logic of this temporary branch only has a survival time of only one week. One week later, when the code logic of the latest develop branch is online and After stabilization, the task of the temporary branch is over, so it is absolutely not allowed to be merged. Merging is equivalent to going back, which is absolutely not allowed.
