### 1. What is the difference between "in the meanwhile" and "at the same time"?

- In the meanwhile
    > This phrase is often used to refer to something happening during the intervening time or while something else is occurring.


    eg:
    I'm waiting for the bus, and in the meanwhile, I'll grab a cup of coffee from the nearby cafe/kæˈfeɪ/
    

    (In this sentence, "in the meanwhile" implies that the person plans to get a cup of coffee while waiting for the bus. It suggests a way to make productive use of the time spent on waiting.)

- At the same time
    This phrase is used when you want to express that two or more events are happening concurrently or simultaneously.

    eg:
    I was studying for my exams, and at the same time, my friend was practicing the guitar in the next room.
    Suddenly all people speak at the same time.


> In summary, "in the meanwhile" is more about something happening during the intervening(介于中间的) /ˌɪntərˈviːnɪŋ/ time, while "at the same time" is about events happening concurrently. The choice between them depends on the nuance(细微差别) /ˈnuːɑːns/
 you want to convey in your sentence.
