### ring a bell

> The information or the topic mentioned is somewhat familiar, though they might not have all the details or might not remember it completely. (eg: That name sounds familiar; it rings a bell)

```
Person A: "Have you ever heard of Jane Smith?"
Person B: "Hmm, the name doesn't ring a bell. Who is she?"

In this example, Person B is indicating that they don't immediately recognize the name Jane Smith, but they are open to learning more or having their memory jogged. It's a way of expressing a degree of familiarity without necessarily recalling all the specific details.

### have one's memory jogged

> To be reminded of something, especially a forgotten or overlooked(忽略的) memory. When someone or something "jogs your memory," it helps you recall information or events that you might not have remembered initially.

```
Person A: "I can't remember where we met before."
Person B: "It was at Sarah's birthday party last year, remember?"
Person A: "Oh, yes! Thanks for jogging my memory."

In this context, Person B's reminder about the birthday party jogged or prompted Person A's memory, helping them remember the specific event. It's a way of saying that the information was there but needed a little prompt to be recalled.
