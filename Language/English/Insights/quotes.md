越是精明的人，对真正单纯善良的人并不会设防，会很珍惜，老实人踏实和专一的品质对他们来说是最渴望拥有的，他们甚至会把自己防备其他人攒下来的资源一次性全扔给这样的老实人。
> The smarter someone is, the less guarded they are around genuinely pure and kind-hearted individuals. They appreciate and cherish sincerity, simplicity, and the qualities of being straightforward and loyal. To them, the qualities of an honest and down-to-earth person are the most desired. They might even willingly throw all the resources they've accumulated in caution against others at once to someone with such genuine qualities.
