## Building Your Own Data Assets

> Leveraging the "Tool Mindset" for Online Recognition

<hr>

I want to talk about something that applies to everyone, regardless of the project you're working on – minimizing your upfront investment and turning your project into a tool for gaining traction and recognition.

Let's take those folks in rural areas who are into farming or live streaming, for example. They're using what I call the "tool mindset." They use specific tools or strategies to tag themselves and create an identity. For instance, if someone is into growing tomatoes, they label themselves as "tomato enthusiasts," and if it's vegetables and fruits, they go for the "vegetable and fruit expert" tag.

Now, imagine this: you create short videos and livestreams showcasing how your tomatoes grow without fertilizers or the use of pesticides for weed control. The tomatoes you produce are no different from those high-tech ones, but here's the kicker – your short videos and livestreams become your data assets. You, my friend, become the 'Tomato Guru,' and when someone searches for tomatoes, the platform directs them to your livestream.

Online traffic always surpasses offline, so it's crucial to quickly upload your offline achievements and experiences online, turning them into your data assets. A tomato in the offline world might decay and become rotten, but if you transform it into your tag through short videos and livestreams, that tag will persist, continually creating value for you.

In a nutshell, ramp up your visibility and establish your own data assets as soon as possible.
