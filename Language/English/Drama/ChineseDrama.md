> A man should have three wallets. The first one is how much money you actually have, the second is your credit, and the third is what others think you have in your wallet. The last one is most important, it's about how much money you can leverage from other people's wallet.

一个男人应该拥有三个钱包。第一个是你实际有多少钱，第二个是你的信用，第三个是别人认为你钱包里有多少钱。最后一个是最重要的，它关乎你能从别人的钱包里撬动多少钱。
